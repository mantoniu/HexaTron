# API Initializer

The API initializer is responsible for merging the APIs generated by each service. It requests the API file from each
service by passing the service URL through the environment variable ```SERVICE_URL```. As a result, the initializer is
launched only after all services are fully up and reachable.

Once it has successfully merged all the API files, the initializer sends the final result to the file service, which is
then responsible for saving it. After completing its task, the initializer container shuts down automatically, ensuring
that it runs only when needed and conserves resources.

If any errors occur during the file reception or when sending the merged API to the file service, the initializer will
log the error before shutting down, providing clear diagnostics for any issues that arise. Additionally, it logs the
successful reception of the merged API by the file service.
